# 🧮 BMI Calculator in Python

This is a simple **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** written in Python. It allows users to input their weight and height, and it calculates their BMI along with a health category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

---

## 📋 Features

* Takes user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
* Calculates BMI using the standard formula:

  $$
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
  $$
* Classifies BMI into:

  * Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
  * Normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25)
  * Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30)
  * Obese (BMI ≥ 30)
